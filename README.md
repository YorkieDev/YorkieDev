### Self-Taught Python Developer | Aspiring Data Analyst

I'm a self-taught Python developer building my skills in data analysis and looking to break into a data-focused role. Without a traditional degree, I've taken a hands-on approach to learning, building real projects and developing practical skills that translate to real-world work.

My focus is on Python, data manipulation, and creating tools that make sense of information. I enjoy working with data, automating repetitive tasks, and finding patterns that tell a story.

## What I'm Working On
- Data analysis projects using Python, Pandas, and NumPy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- SQL queries and database management
- Automation scripts and data pipelines
- Building a portfolio of data-driven projects

## My Learning Path
Coming from a non-traditional background, I've developed my skills through:
- Online courses and self-directed study
- Hands-on projects and real-world problem solving
- Reading documentation and technical resources
- Consistent practice and continuous improvement
