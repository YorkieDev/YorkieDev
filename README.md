## 🎮 About Me

I'm a QA Tester with a background in **Games Testing**, currently transitioning into **Software QA**. I combine my quality assurance expertise with a passion for front end development, built entirely through self-directed learning.

Beyond tech, I'm a **Community Manager**, enjoy **building gaming PCs**, and have a growing **comic book collection**.
